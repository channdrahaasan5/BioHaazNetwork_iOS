## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Offline Queue Enhancement
- ✅ **Fixed**: Offline queue now supports DELETE, PUT, and PATCH methods in addition to POST
- ✅ Previously, only POST requests were queued when offline
- ✅ DELETE and UPDATE operations now properly queue when network is unavailable
- ✅ All queued requests (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) are automatically processed when network is restored

### What Changed
- Updated offline queue logic to handle all mutating HTTP methods
- DELETE requests are now queued when offline
- PUT/PATCH (update) requests are now queued when offline
- Improved debug logging to show the correct HTTP method in queue messages
